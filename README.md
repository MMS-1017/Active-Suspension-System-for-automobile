# Active-Suspension-System-for-automobile

By integrating sensors, actuators and control systems, the project aims to dynamically adjust the suspension to varying road conditions and driving scenarios.

Active Suspension Control: Automatically elevates the vehicle when it detects a bump.

Embedded Systems Integration: Utilizes ARM-based microcontrollers, MATLAB/Simulink, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino.

Computer Vision: Raspberry Pi for real-time bump detection.

Embedded Control: Arduino for controlling the MPU (Motorized Platform Unit).

MATLAB/Simulink Simulation: For designing and simulating the suspension system.
